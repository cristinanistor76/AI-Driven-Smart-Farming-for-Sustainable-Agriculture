# AI-Driven-Smart-Farming-for-Sustainable-Agriculture
The project aims to develop an AI-powered system that assists farmers in making data-driven decisions to optimize crop yield while minimizing resource usage such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides. The system would use predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and automated suggestions to improve farming efficiency and sustainability.
